Title: Uses Brown's method to combine p-values from dependent tests
Version: 0.99.2
Author: William Poole
Maintainer: David Gibbs <dgibbs@systemsbiology.org>
Description: Combining P-values from multiple statistical tests is common in bioinformatics. However, this procedure is non-trivial for dependent P-values. This package implements an empirical adaptation of Brown’s Method (an extension of Fisher’s Method) for combining dependent P-values which is appropriate for highly correlated data sets found in high-throughput biological experiments.
